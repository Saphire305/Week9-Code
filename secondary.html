                <h2>My Harley</h2>
                <p>I first purchased my Harley May 2, 2021. I got a 2002 FLSTFI or Fat Boy and this was my birthday present to myself.
                    I've ridden dirtbike before but this was my first ever street bike. I've used it to learn how to ride on the street
                    and get my motorcycle endorsement.
                </p>

            <div class="container col my-auto">
                <h2>Practice</h2>
                <p>I started out riding a dirtbike again as it had been years since I've been on two wheels. I used the dirtbike to help get me 
                    used to being on two wheels again before going out on the street. Once I was ready, my dad and I went for our first ride together
                    traveling our local backroads where there was very limited traffic to make learning easier. We also went to the local highschool
                    where I could practice some slower maneuvers that I would need to pass the two-wheeled endorsement skills tests.

                <h2>For Fun</h2>
                <p>I'll ride this bike all over the place for really any reason. I ride it to work constantly, I've taken it to the grocery store,
                    to show off to friends or just because. In this picture, I had taken my puppy to the vet with her wrapped in my jacket. The nurses
                    at the vet met me outside and asked if they could take a picture when I had rolled up! I now have this picture as my Facebook profile
                    picture. I once used it for a grocery run where I had both saddle bags over flowing and still had three bags of cereal sitting on my
                    lap on the way home!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In short, you can do whatever you want with your bike if you've got one. Go have some fun and do some not so practical things with
                    it just because! If you don't have a bike, I hope this convinces you to at least consider getting one.
                </p>
